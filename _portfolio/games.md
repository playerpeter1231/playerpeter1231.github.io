Pico-8 is a wonderful little engine for building games under the toughest of constraints, so I have used it as my playground for testing table operations and sturdy table functions for more functional kinds of applications. Here are my version of Sudoku using a live error detection and a Japanese Kanji flashcard game.

And just for fun, my first set of test games were small enough that I was able to put them all together into a pack. The first two do follow tutorials, but the third was my earnest attempt at building my own kind of shoot-em-up. Still fun to look back at.
