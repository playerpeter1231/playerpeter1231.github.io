## Forward

Blender is my guilty pleasure as someone who has always enjoyed designing scenes and stories, while having a perfectionist outlook on my art. Final products should by no means look like they were manufactured in a perfect factory setting, but the most interesting designs start from an intricate understanding of the world as a whole, infamously difficult to convey through pencil and paper. In comes Blender with its wonderful ability to marry programming with art, and you've got my perfect hobby to my hobby. Now that I have upgraded my system to handle it, I have been able to go from following Blender tutorials as a form of entertainment to actually building and solving my own problems on my own. Let me show you what I've worked with so far.

## 2022 Projects

My first work in progress project I have was inspired by my favorite unique piece of Finnish architecture, the sauna. I plan to return to it as my baseline for practicing particle sims and nature paths while cranking the Cycles renderer. After I finish texturing too of course!

The second project I am working on is a fun windmill project is in active development. You may see it change in front of your very eyes! Original inspiration is by [Mario Javier on Behance][behance-link]
