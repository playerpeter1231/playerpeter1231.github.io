My bulk of my experience has come from my time with the Reno Computer Fix, a small local shop that focused on customer computer repair but evolved into more business to business opportunities. While I don't have much of the internal projects here to show you, I can describe the work that I did while here.

When the pandemic started, we lost nearly all of our employees, meaning our team downsized to just the owner, myself, and our remote tech. Business was minimal, but we were able to survive by providing local business fulfillment, IT support, and websites/digital marketting. As we were picking up steam, I was able to hire more and more employees to fit the roles as I saw fit. This was when I learned many important skills in training, working together, and genuinely supporting my team members in their different ways, and in their different experiences.

It's an understatement to say we rebuilt our shop, as we tore down the previous frameworks and systems to start over from scratch. Replacing our old Quickbooks database, I implemented a repair oriented database that we could access from any computer within the shop. Ever job would be provided a custom barcode, would be scanned into our system through python function calls, and then have documentation every step of the way. This allowed us to take deposits as necessary for jobs, and work together on jobs that used to be up to an individual previously. I still worked with customer's daily, whether they were looking for help with their first ever laptop or needing assistance with their company's framework, but with the new system in place, we were better able to distribute the load.

The shop itself received a facelift as well, where we tore down our shelves and walls to build new offices and a pretty wood floor and freshly painted entryway. All of this was done while still open for operation, making for an interesting challenge of still completing projects while building walls in front of our customers. Our jobs had grown in scope as well, leading for me and my team taking a variety of jobs from fixing pharmaceutical prescription machines and massive servers at the mega-church in town. Every day brought something fun and unique, and I was proud of what we built during my time in the team.

One last thing, my boss asked for me to show my parting gift whenever I talk about my time in the shop.
