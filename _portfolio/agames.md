## Forward

Here are some of the projects that I am able to show some of my work on, though they represent what I have done through my hobby. While I am able to finish games and projects, it has only been recently that I got my own system that can handle development at home. So do bear with my thin portfolio as I continue to add to it in the coming weeks.

## Unity and Godot

We utilized Unity in my university classes for simple games and simulations. I plan to return to using it to develop my prototype I have planned for a mobile tactics game that joins the competitive choices of games such as MOBAs or class shooters, and the fun decision making from lighter games such as Fire Emblem and FF Tactics. As I work on it, I will be releasing dev-blog posts periodically on my main page.

Working in 2D, I have found that the younger brother to Unity, Godot, is a strong competitor if you like platforming and puzzle games. My goal is to implement the rest of my ideas I have for the game to explore the code environment of GDScript further. Then I can then move to developing a larger project that brings different gameplay styles, such as farming and hands on crafting, to a larger experience along the lines of Recettear. Godot works great with developing on mobile too, so I am developing my projects in mind of the mobile platform.

For now, here's my [Godot project in playable form][itch-player], and the [code uploaded to Github][Github-Project].

## Pico-8

Pico-8 is a wonderful little engine for building games under the toughest of constraints, allowing it to be ran on any potato. This was my engine of choice for the several years I was working full-time computer repair, and is perfect for hobby coding in a responsive and lightweight environment.

Here are my version of Sudoku using a live error detection and a Japanese Kanji flashcard game.

And just for fun, my first set of test games were small enough that I was able to put them all together into a pack. The first two do follow tutorials, but the third was my earnest attempt at building my own kind of shoot-em-up, if you [want to take a look at them][lexa-forum]
