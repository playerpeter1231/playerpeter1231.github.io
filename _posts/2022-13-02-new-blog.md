Here is where I'm going to move my project posts and discussion posts that I have had in the past so that it is all in one big location. Being perfectly honest, this site will be really active over the next couple weeks, and die down once I have found a full-time project to focus on completely. Until then, new content will be discussions into game design as well as game development, and anything I find cool along the way! If you have any questions or want to add in any way, you can currently reach me on [Twitter][Twitter-Site] for quick questions or conversations, and my email [peterrowe.tech@gmail.com][Email-Site] for business. Comment support for individual posts will be added for posts in the future.

That's about all for now though. Here's to new beginnings!
