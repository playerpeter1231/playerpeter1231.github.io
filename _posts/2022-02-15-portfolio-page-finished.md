Check it out if you haven't already!

I have built the framework for me to present my projects in a digestable way, and have included write-ups of my work from the past! Now that it is done, I can finally get back to the work of my present and future. You can visit it here!

Don't think it's all I can offer, I'll be adding more work to this website over the forseeable future to show you what I've got! For now, enjoy!
