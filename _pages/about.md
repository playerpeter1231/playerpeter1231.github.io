This webpage was created as a way to consolidate and show all of my projects that work with HTML, as well as host resources about me such as my portfolio and blogposts. It was created using a Jekyll Theme called Minimal-Mistakes, originally found [here][Jekyll-Site]. If you have any questions for me, I am responsive on my [Twitter][Twitter-Site], I would be happy to talk.

If you are interested in discussing work, I am looking to join a team right now. My email is [peterrowe.tech@gmail.com][Email-Site].
